#Player class, Game Class, and a question class
#game class >  player and question class

#player class = takes care of lives, boolean is_alive = if life = 0
#change is_alive to false
#initalize with 3 lives each player

#question class create 2 vars num1 and num2 and use randome num function
#method that creates question puts what does (num1) plus (num2) equal?
#new method finds answer to question num1 + num2


#Game Class initalize player class with player1 and 2** @player1 = Player.new(p1)***
#init current player   @currentPlayer = Player1, Player2
